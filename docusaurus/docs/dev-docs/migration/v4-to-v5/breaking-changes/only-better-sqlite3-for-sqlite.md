</SideBySideContainer>

## Migration

<MigrationIntro />

### Notes

* Strapi 5 uses the `better-sqlite3` package for SQLite databases under the hood and rewrites the `sqlite` option as `better-sqlite3` for Knex.
* Additional information about database clients and configuration can be found in the [database configuration](/dev-docs/configurations/database) documentation.

### Manual procedure

No manual migration should be required as codemods from the [upgrade tool](/dev-docs/upgrade-tool) will handle this change.

In case you want to manually migrate, run the following commands in the terminal:

1. Run `yarn remove sqlite3` to remove the sqlite 3 package.
2. Run `yarn add better-sqlite3` to install the `better-sqlite3` package.
